# gha-runner
A simple GitHub Action for creating self-hosted runners. Currently, this only supports AWS and x86_64 Linux AMIs. This runner is heavily inspired by [ec2-github-runner](https://github.com/machulav/ec2-github-runner) but rewritten to support additional cloud providers and to better meet some needs of the OMSF community.

## Testing the action in development
Testing the action was primarily done using [nektos/act]("https://github.com/nektos/act") to test locally. To do a test run with some basic defaults:
```yaml
name: Testing
on: [push]

jobs:
  hello_world_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Test the gha_runner
    steps:
      # To use this repository's private action,
      # you must check out the repository
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Local runner run
        id: aws_start
        uses: ./ # Uses an action in the root directory
        with:
          repo: "testing/testing"
          provider: "aws"
          action: "start"
          aws_image_id: <use an image here that has docker installed>
          aws_instance_type: t2.micro
          instance_count: 2
          aws_region_name: us-east-1
          aws_home_dir: /home/ec2-user
          aws_labels: testing
        env:
          GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      - name: Stop instances
        uses: ./
        with:
          repo: "testing/testing"
          provider: "aws"
          action: "stop"
          instance_mapping: ${{ steps.aws_start.outputs.mapping }}
          aws_region_name: us-east-1
        env:
          GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}


```
_NOTE: For guidelines on setting secrets view the act docs found [here](https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html?highlight=Secrets#secrets)_
This file was placed in a `test-worklows` directory.

Then it was run using the following:
```sh
act -W test-workflows/ --verbose
```

For testing on M-series Macs, use the following command instead:
```sh
act --container-architecture linux/arm64 -W test-workflows/ --verbose
```

## Acknowledgements
This action was heavily inspired by the [ec2-github-runner](https://github.com/machulav/ec2-github-runner). This action takes much of its structure and inspiration around architecture from the `ec2-github-runner` itself. Thank you to the authors of that action for providing a solid foundation to build upon.
